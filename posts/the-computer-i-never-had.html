    <h1>The Computer I Never Had</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">A Journey from Khotokha to Code</h2>

    <p>
      I was two years old when my parents divorced. I never saw my father again after that.
      My mother packed up what little we had and returned to her village with me and my brother
      in tow. I don’t remember those early years clearly, but I know they were hard.
      My mom carried burdens no one should have to carry alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up in Khotokha, a small village where life moved at a different pace.
      When people talk about the digital divide, they’re talking about places like where I grew up.
      Forget computers and laptops. I didn’t even know what a smartphone was.
      The internet was something that existed somewhere else, for someone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned from textbooks, the same ones year after year, and I never really had a chance
      to explore beyond those worn pages. But something in me was curious.
      Even then, I sensed there was a bigger world out there.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I moved to Samtengang Central School for middle school, things changed slightly.
      We had IT courses. There was a computer lab we could use once a week.
      As a boarding student, that one hour was all I got.
    </p>

    <p>
      During vacations, whatever momentum I had built evaporated.
      I went back to the village. No devices. No connection.
      Asking for a computer felt impossible.

    <h3>The Turn</h3>

    <p>
      In 2022, my life took an unexpected turn. I went to Norway to study the International
      Baccalaureate. Suddenly, I had real access.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started teaching myself. Everything I’d been curious about for years,
      I could finally pursue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I’m at Wheaton College, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
      I want to solve real-world problems. I want to build things that matter.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Wish I’d Known</h3>

    <p>
      You don’t need expensive devices to start. Access helps, yes.
      But curiosity and persistence matter more.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t need permission from anyone.
      You can create your own path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your background is not your ceiling.
      Where you start doesn’t determine where you finish.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I’m Writing This</h3>

    <p>
      I’m writing this for the student in a village somewhere who’s curious about technology
      but doesn’t see a path forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start where you are. Use what you have.
      The journey doesn’t require perfect conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computer I never had in primary school?
      I have it now. And I’m using it to build a future I once thought was impossible.
    </p>

    <p><strong>You can too.</strong></p>
