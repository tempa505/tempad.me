          I'm a computer science student and creative builder drawn to the space
          where logic meets art. I enjoy turning ideas into experiences, whether
          that's through code, design, or storytelling.

      <h2>Education & Background</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science major with a Data Science minor, and a proud alumna
        of UWC Red Cross Nordic in Norway, where I learned that fjords are beautiful,
        but winter darkness is very real.
      </p>

        I come from a small village in Bhutan, where the pace of life moves with
        the seasons, prayer flags flutter in mountain winds, and the internet
        arrives fashionably late. That contrast fuels my work today: bridging the
        quiet wisdom of my roots with the buzzing possibilities of the digital age.
